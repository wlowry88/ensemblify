## Background

As classical musicians ourselves, weâ€™ve noticed it can be hard to find other musicians with whom to play chamber music. We created Ensemblify to try to fill this void. We hope it lets people connect with new friends and provides a fun way to keep music in your lives.

## Features

Users can:  
  log in through facebook  
  create a new ensemble  
  * invite other users to their ensemble  
  * add musical pieces to their ensemble
  browse other users' ensembles  
  * ask to join others' ensembles  
  search musicians and ensembles  
  message other users  

## Future

We would like to:  
  * allow ensembles to coordinate and promote concerts  
  * allow members of an ensemble to arrange rehearsal times and spaces
