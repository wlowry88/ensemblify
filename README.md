## Background

As classical musicians ourselves, weâ€™ve noticed it can be hard to find other musicians with whom to play chamber music. We created Ensemblify to try to fill this void. We hope it lets people connect with new friends and provides a fun way to keep music in your lives.

## Features

Users can:
  log in through facebook
  create a new ensemble
    invite other users to their ensemble
    add musical pieces to their ensemble
  browse other users' ensembles
    ask to join others' ensembles
  search musicians and ensembles
  message other users

## Future

We would like to:
  allow ensembles to coordinate and promote concerts
  allow members of an ensemble to arrange rehearsal times and spaces
